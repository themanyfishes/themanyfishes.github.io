<p style="text-align:center"></p>Although the field of fish cognition has a reasonably long history, the past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the number of fish cognition studies.
Yet, there exists important limitations to our assessment of fish cognition—including issues of reliability and validity—due to the use of small sample sizes, nonrepresentative samples, and unstandardized protocols.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"></p>Recently, several Big Team Science initiatives (aka Many"X" Projects) have begun to address these issues in single taxa.
In the same spirit, <b>ManyFishes uses an approach based on collaboration across researchers and institutions in an attempt to increase both number and diversity of fish samples used in cognitive research.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>ManyFishes' primary goal is to have researchers develop appropriate procedures for wide application across species and settings. Such procedures should be highly standardized for direct cross-species comparisons, yet suitably adapted to the species under investigation.</p>
